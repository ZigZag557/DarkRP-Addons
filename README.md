# Description
  These are the addons I have created for a server owner. Thankfully, he was nice enough to let me share these addons for free.

  
  * Feel free to use these addons without having to credit me as long as you don't credit someone else.
  * Feel free to modify, enhance, customize these addons as you wish.\n
  * Feel free to send push requests or tell me about the issues that are in my code. I would be glad to hear from you!\n
  
  More information can be found inside addons.
  
  Yes I was too lazy to create a new settings.lua for most of the addons.
